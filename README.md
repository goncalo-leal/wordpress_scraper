# wordpress_scraper
This project was created to get all poems from my mother's blog automatically.

To do this I had to use a workaround from the normal scraper, because the home page does not show all poems.
So, I searched for the categories list and went through all the categories' URLs and then I applied the scraper to get all the poems from each category.

Some poems were in more than one category, but since I was using dictionaries I had no problem with repeated poems.

To complete this project I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U90vK84bq4s&t=475s">this</a> youtube tutorial.
